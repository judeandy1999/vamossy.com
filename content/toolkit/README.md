# LLM Governance Toolkit

[![Stress Tests](https://github.com/Gergo89/llm-governance-toolkit/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Gergo89/llm-governance-toolkit/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

*Practical, honestly-scoped tools and patterns for making LLM and agent workflows trustworthy — by making their limits explicit and keeping a human holding the pen.*

This is a small, coherent set of applied AI-safety engineering pieces. Each is deliberately narrow, deterministic where it can be, and honest about what it does not do. None of it claims to be novel theory; the contribution is **operability** — turning risks most teams understand abstractly into concrete, runnable artifacts.

## What's here

### Tools (reference implementations, deterministic, self-testing)

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `tools/goodhart_auditor.py` | An **epistemic linter**: flags fields/metrics whose *name* claims a verified property (`reviewed`, `verified`) that nothing actually checks. |
| `tools/knowledge_maturity.py` | A **deterministic evidence-maturity classifier**: rates *how much evidentiary work stands behind a claim* (not whether it's true), with critical gates that quantity can't buy past. |
| `patterns/containment_guard.py` | A **fail-closed guard** that rejects any agent action which isn't human-authorized, reversible, bounded, and logged. |
| `tools/optimal_timing.py` | An **optimal-stopping timing layer**: from a cost structure (false-alarm vs miss) and an evidence model, it solves the Bayes-optimal *act-or-wait* boundary on the posterior — the decision layer that sits on top of any early-warning forecast and answers *when* to act. |
| `tools/decoupling_monitor.py` | A **Goodhart-in-the-wild monitor**: watches a reported `proxy` against an independent `truth` signal and alerts when the proxy keeps improving while the truth degrades — operational metric gaming, caught (in the demo) 17 steps before visible failure. |
| `tools/ground_truth_auditor.py` | A **ground-truth independence auditor**: checks whether the `truth` signal a decoupling monitor relies on is actually independent of the proxy (shadow detection without a reference; error-correlation with one), so you know whether a decoupling alarm means anything. Attacks the binding constraint every other tool depends on. |
| `tools/eval_gaming_detector.py` | A **defensive eval-gaming / sandbagging detector** (AI-native): flags when a model-evaluation score is decoupled from true capability — *contamination* (inflated → undermines a capability claim) or *sandbagging* (hidden → undermines an inability/safety claim). Per-eval signals (held-out gap, elicitation gap, non-monotone difficulty profile) plus a revision-stream monitor that reuses the decoupling monitor and ground-truth auditor. Abstract scores only; no techniques. |

Every tool runs its own self-test: `python <file>.py`.

Two of these close the loop with the wider work in this project. `decoupling_monitor` is the operational complement to `goodhart_auditor`: the auditor catches a metric that *overclaims by name* at definition time; the monitor catches one that was honest but is *being gamed in operation* (the same proxy-vs-reality divergence as the money model's peg drifting from its backing, and "same price, worse product" hidden inflation). `optimal_timing` is the decision layer for early-warning systems: given a forecast (e.g. a collapse probability) and a cost asymmetry, it computes the act threshold — and it composes with the rest of the toolkit, since an "act now" recommendation still routes through non-self-approval and containment before anything executes.

### The consolidation layer

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `soi/soi_pipeline.py` | The **Scientific Knowledge-Governance ("order") pipeline**: one deterministic function that assigns and maintains a claim's *epistemic-status order* (`PROVISIONAL → WORKING_BASIS → MULTI_DOMAIN_TESTED → VALIDATED → CANONICAL_CANDIDATE`) by wiring the three tools below into five stages — maturity, disclosed open issues, metric hygiene, non-self-approval, adoption-vs-validation. It orders claims by *status*, never by *truth*; human authority is final. Self-testing: `python soi/soi_pipeline.py`. |
| `soi/SOI-000_...Infrastructure.md` | The spec: scope, the claim it does and doesn't make, object model, the ordering pipeline, authority model, limitations, and honest positioning. |

This is the piece the rest of the toolkit points at: the individual tools are the enforceable components; `soi_pipeline` is the single ordering pipeline that composes them, and it ships two runnable demonstrations (a foundational-ontology derivation and a high-consequence "is it sentient?" claim) showing the order withhold what it must and promote only what earns each gate.

### Patterns (design writeups)

| File | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `patterns/agent_containment_pattern.md` | Composing agents so **non-autonomy is structural, not behavioral** — they propose; a gate + a human authorize; an external executor performs one reversible action. |
| `patterns/federation_pattern.md` | **System-of-systems** composition (router → specialists → synthesis) with artifact-only exchange and no shared memory, so capability scales without creating one opaque super-agent. |
| `patterns/non_self_approving_derivation.md` | Letting an AI do deep derivation (ontologies, option scoring, decision records) while making it **structurally unable to certify its own conclusions** — deterministic generation, self-reported open problems, non-averaged scoring, blank human-authority signatures. |

### Companion documents

- `REF_Literature_Crosswalk.md` — for the `non_self_approving_derivation` pattern's foundational-ontology worked example: maps the derived ontology onto the existing formal-ontology and metaphysics literature (Spencer-Brown, ontic structural realism, process philosophy, constraint-closure, BFO/DOLCE/UFO, OntoClean), separating genuine re-derivation from the method's real novelty, and listing what a submission would need to engage.
- `CEM_SAI_Consciousness_Crosswalk.md` — the same treatment for the pattern's *high-consequence assessment* worked example (machine consciousness, sentience, ASI candidacy): maps the in-house consciousness and sentience modules onto the science of consciousness (Butlin/Long et al. 2023 indicator-property approach, IIT, Global Workspace, Higher-Order, Recurrent Processing, Attention Schema, Block's access/phenomenal split) and the AI-welfare literature (Long/Sebo et al. 2024, Birch's precautionary sentience framework). Same verdict shape: the framework is an uncredited re-derivation of an active literature, and the real novelty is the governance wrapper — so publish the apparatus, engage the science as scholarship. Both crosswalks illustrate the same lesson the toolkit is built around: keep the disciplined method well away from any totalizing theory.

### Companion framework

The broader **QIERA epistemic-governance overlay** (the L0–L6 reasoning pipeline these pieces slot into) is documented separately. The tools here are the enforceable components; QIERA is the pipeline that produces the artifacts they check.

## The one idea underneath all of it

Modern LLMs are fluent, confident, and agreeable — a combination that *feels* like help and *behaves* like risk in high-stakes work. Every piece here engineers against one facet of that:

- the **Goodhart auditor** attacks *names that claim more than they check*;
- the **maturity classifier** attacks *confidence that outruns evidence*;
- the **containment guard** attacks *actions that outrun human authority*;
- the **patterns** keep authority *traceable and human-held* as systems grow.

A recurring design choice ties them together: the governance components are themselves **deterministic and self-testing**, because a governance tool that can't demonstrate its own correctness is worse than none. Where a tool has a blind spot, that blind spot is in its test suite, not hidden.

## The reachability of the ground truth

Every tool here rests on one question: **can you get an independent measure of the truth to check the proxy against?** Read across domains, that question has a spectrum of answers, and the honest response scales with it.

At one end sits **computational geometry**, where the truth is *exactly computable*. The "edge cases" there are literal — degenerate configurations on the boundary of general position (three collinear points, a query point exactly on an edge), where a floating-point predicate (the proxy) can return the wrong sign for the true, exact answer. Because the truth is reachable, the fix is decisive: compute it exactly (Shewchuk's robust predicates; Yap's Exact Geometric Computation; Edelsbrunner–Mücke's Simulation of Simplicity). Here decoupling is not merely *detected* but *eliminated* — the proxy is corrected against an exact ground truth. This is `ground_truth_auditor`'s principle in the domain where it fully succeeds.

The **middle** is where this toolkit lives: metrics, evaluations, digital twins, mappings, safety-case evidence. The truth is *partially and independently observable* — enough to catch decoupling (`decoupling_monitor`), audit the independence of the check itself (`ground_truth_auditor`), and withhold honestly (`UNVERIFIED`) where no independent measure exists.

At the far end sits **consciousness**, where no third-person ground truth exists even in principle. The honest verdict is permanently `UNVERIFIABLE` (see `qualia_report_governor` and the *Recorded, Not Verified* paper) — an edge case of the *tool*, not the *world*.

Same structure throughout; only one axis moves — the reachability of the truth — and the honest response moves with it: **solve → detect → withhold.** The geometry pole matters most for reading the rest: it is the case where an independent ground truth actually closes the gap, which is exactly why its *absence* elsewhere is meaningful rather than a mere shrug.

## Honest positioning (read this before publishing or presenting)

- This is **applied engineering and safety patterns**, not new science. It aligns with — and is best presented as a practitioner's synthesis of — human-in-the-loop design, non-agentic tool use, capability control, Goodhart's law, uncertainty quantification, and provenance/audit.
- Every component is **narrow by design** and states its limits explicitly. The tools are heuristics and gates, not proofs.
- Keep this work **separate from any speculative or metaphysical material.** These pieces stand because they are modest, testable, and honest; adjacency to grand unfalsifiable claims would undercut exactly the credibility that makes them worth publishing.

### Applicability and exclusions

This toolkit is **not safety-critical software** and must not sit on the critical path of any life- or mission-critical control function. It carries none of the assurance evidence such roles require: it is not developed or verified to **DO-178C** (up to Design Assurance Level A) or **DO-254** for airborne systems, to **IEC 61508** Safety Integrity Levels (with their quantified dangerous-failure targets — SIL 4 ≈ 10⁻⁴–10⁻⁵ probability of failure on demand), to **IEC 61513 / IEC 60880 / IEEE 7-4.3.2** for nuclear **Class 1E** instrumentation and control, or to **MIL-STD-882** system-safety practice; it provides no formal proof, no hardware fault tolerance, no redundancy or diversity, no real-time determinism, and no independent V&V, and its containment gate presumes reversible, bounded actions — so it deliberately (and correctly) refuses the irreversible actuation those domains turn on, such as a reactor-scram thermal transient, a released store, or a launched vehicle. Its legitimate role in nuclear, aerospace, and defense contexts is confined to the **non-safety-critical AI and analytical layer** — governing ML/LLM components, decision *support*, evidence-maturity ordering, metric-gaming audits, and non-self-approval of analyses — always advisory, off the critical path, with certified systems and human authorities retaining control. Where its ethos aligns with meaningful-human-control principles (e.g. **DoD Directive 3000.09**), that is alignment in intent, not certification of fitness: it must **not** be treated as a control element in flight-critical, reactor-protection, or nuclear command-and-control / weapons-release functions.

## Compliance layer — [`compliance-toolkit/`](compliance-toolkit/)

The tools above operate on a *running* system: they catch a proxy decoupling
from truth, an unverified claim dressed as a verified one, an agent action that
isn't reversible or authorised. [`compliance-toolkit/`](compliance-toolkit/)
sits one level up, on the *organisational* process that decides which systems
get built and deployed at all.

```bash
cd compliance-toolkit && pip install -e ".[dev]"
llmgov score      # tier every registered use case
llmgov validate   # schema + policy-as-code checks; exits 1 on findings
```

The same honesty constraint applies here as everywhere else in this repository:
the framework crosswalks say *"this control contributes evidence toward that
requirement"* and never *"that requirement is satisfied."* Mapping a control to
an article is not a conformity assessment, and none of it is legal advice.

## Quick start

```bash
python tools/goodhart_auditor.py       # self-test + demo
python tools/knowledge_maturity.py     # self-test + demo
python patterns/containment_guard.py   # self-test + demo
```

No dependencies beyond the Python standard library. The compliance layer in
[`compliance-toolkit/`](compliance-toolkit/) additionally needs PyYAML and
jsonschema.
